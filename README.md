# Overview 📘

This repository contains a complete predictive maintenance analysis workflow built using Python, combining sensor analytics, anomoly detection, FMEA-driven reliability insights, and automated maintenance
scheduling. 

The project demonstrates how real-world maintenance engineering, failure mode assessment, and data science techniques can be integrated into a repeatable, scalable process.

This is a showcase of skills on:

    Data Analytics
    
    Statistical modeling
    
    Reliability engineering
    
    Failure prediction
    
    Maintenance planning
    
    Technical reporting
    
    Visualization (dashboards + gantt charts)

# Key Features 🛠️

✔ Sensor Data Analysis

    Vibration, current draw, and temperature signals

    Time-series KPI trends

    Degradation modeling

    Multi-asset comparison (Motor A vs Motor B)

✔ Anomaly Detection

    Regression-based anomaly trend modeling

    Rolling 95% confidence intervals

    Predicted failure threshold identification

    Automatic failure estimation date

✔ Reliability Engineering Integration

    Full FMEA (Failure Modes & Effects Analysis) incorporated

    Detection, occurrence, severity scoring

    Action plan extracted directly from the FMEA spreadsheet

✔ Automated Gantt Chart Generation

    Two project schedules are included:

    Corrective Action Gantt Chart
    Derived from the FMEA table (task name, priority, duration).

    Predictive Maintenance Routine Gantt Chart
    Modeled from best-practice PM intervals and project findings.

    Both Gantt charts are generated using Python + Matplotlib.

✔ Professional Maintenance Report

    A fully formatted DOCX report is automatically generated, including:

    Executive summary

    KPI plots

    Predictive modeling

    Failure forecasting

    FMEA interpretation

    Pre- and post-work actions

    Maintenance recommendations

# Dashboards Included 📈

## Sensor KPIs

    Vibration Over Time – Motor A vs Motor B

    Temperature Over Time

    Current Draw Over Time

**Predictive Maintenance Dashboard (2×2 Layout):** Shows all KPIs combined for leadership-level reporting.

## Anomaly Score Curve

    Rolling confidence interval

    Predicted failure day annotation

    Threshold-based degradation modeling

# Predictive Modeling 🧮

A regression-based anomaly model is used to predict when a motor will cross a risk threshold.

The algorithm includes:

    Linear regression

    Residual analysis

    Rolling window statistics

    Confidence interval envelope

    Automatic failure projection

# Gantt Charts 📊

## Using Microsoft Project for Gantt Charts 📅

While this repository provides Python-generated gantt charts for automation and reproducibility, **Microsoft Project** is also an excellent platform for building interactive Gantt schedules,
resource plans, and dependency driven project timelines. 

For teams that prefer drag-and-drop planning, porfolio management tools, or enterprise workflow integration, Microsoft Project offers a robust, industry-standard environment that complements the Python workflow used in this project. 

**You can learn more or download Microsoft Project here:**

## 1) FMEA-Driven Action Plan

   Generated by parsing the attached FMEA spreadsheet and converting action items into a structured corrective timeline.

<img width="836" height="414" alt="FMEA action plan_gantt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc33578e-a643-4b79-801b-3b3f3839afd6" />

## 2) Predictive Maintenance Routine Gantt Chart

   Built from recommended PM intervals such as:

       Weekly anomaly checks

       Monthly vibration & current analysis

       Quarterly alignment

       Annual rebuild assessment

<img width="840" height="414" alt="preditive maintenance_gantt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/653d965d-e24c-44d2-890b-8de5ff32582b" />

**Both charts are created dynamically.**

# Generated Report 📝

A professional DOCX report is automatically created summarizing:

    Data insights

    FMEA findings

    Anomaly detection output

    Maintenance recommendations

    Updated PM routine

    Before/after workflow improvements

This report is suitable for:

    Stakeholder presentations

    ISO / Audit documentation

    Engineering handoffs

    Portfolio demonstration
